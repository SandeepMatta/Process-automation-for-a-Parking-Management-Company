# Process-automation-for-a-Parking-Management-Company

Business Problem:
Parking Services Company's current point-of-sale (POS) process to collect parking fees is inefficient. Today, Parking Services Company 
implements a POS process in lots, garages, and spaces across all its campuses that relies almost entirely on the cashier and local POS 
systems to manage parking inventory and process payment transactions.

Business Solution:
Parking Services company proposes a plan to improve the POS process to collect parking fees across all lots and garages. Automation 
technology and database management solutions provide the infrastructure for the improved POS process. The primary key in the parking 
management systemâ€™s database is the unique vehicle license plate number, allowing Parking Services Company to simultaneously provide guests 
with frictionless lot or garage ingress / egress procedures, collect parking fees efficiently, and collect guest information to 
improve the parking experience for guests. The improved POS process also facilitates inventory management and allows company to provide
incentives and rewards to loyal members.
